# Streaming_Platform_EDA

The present EDA project was based on the streaming platform movie data made available by Ruchi Bhatia at:
https://www.kaggle.com/ruchi798/movies-on-netflix-prime-video-hulu-and-disney

The purpose of this dataset was to explore statistic distributions in streaming platform movies
(Netflix, Prime Video, Hulu and Disney+), such as:
- Targeted age group 
- Genre distribution
- Age distribution (older movies vs recent)
- Review scores given by IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes VS platform, genre and country of production

Due to the recent update to this dataset made in 2021/12, which removed several features that had been the target 
of analysis in this project, most results in this analysis are likely deprecated. 

I have made available the used/previous version of this dataset in the google drive link below:
